        <div id="looks-text" class="looks-text">Dylan's looks, from the top of his head to the end of his toes, are
            nothing but majestic, I could stare at
            his beautiful face for an eternity and still not get tired of it.I love his short but endlesly pretty hair,
            with a nice compliment of colors, his cute face that I want to kiss. The clothes he wears never fail to
            compliment his beauty. His warm and comforting hands, that I want to forever be holding onto.I love every
            single part of him, and there is nothing that could make me stop loving it.

    <div id="personality-text" class="personality-text">Dylan's charming yet funny personality is what made me fall in
        love with him. He treats me with so much kindness and love, and I will do anything to make sure I treat him the
        same way.His sense of humor keeps me laughing even on my worst days, he is incredibly romantic, and always makes
        sure I know im valued, with everything he does for me. Only an idiot would fail to see how loving he is, and how
        blessed I was to meet him.

    <button class="Time">Time spent with him</button></class>
    <div id="Time-text" class="Time-text"> The time spent with Dylan is incredibly precious to me, I cherish every
        second I get to spend by his side. Being with him always fills me up with joy and love for him. I wish I could
        spend every moment of my life with him. Telling him about every single detail of my day, and hearing him talk
        about his, is all I need to feel happy. Laughing with him, cuddling with him, and just being in his presence
        makes me feel like the luckiest person alive.

    <button class="Ideals">Ideals</button></class>
    <div id="Ideals-text" class="Ideals-text">Dylan and I share so many of the same ideals, but even the ones we do
        not share are great, they allow me to think about the world in so many unique ways, and I feel like every
        conversation with Dylan expands my worldview. Dylan stands for the right things, he is not the kind of person
        who would harm the weaker, no matter the situation. Which makes him a person to look up to, and someone I want
        to spend my life with.

    <div id="letter-text" class="letter-text"> I love you Dylan, you hear these words from me every day, but I fail to
        express how much I truly mean them. You are my world, my everything, I spend my whole day thinking about you,
        and your handsome face. I think about you throughout the day, the night, and even my dreams are filled with you.
        I love you more than just words can say, every inch of your body, every little part of your personality, every
        second spent with you is loved by me. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, as your wife, and the person
        who fills you with joy. I love laughing at the smallest things with you, I love feeling your body's warmth, I
        love talking to you about anything and everything. You are the best gift the world has ever given me, I don't
        need anything in this world, except you. Nothing is guaranteed in this universe, except my love for you, nothing
        is perfect, except you, except us. I fully believe we were destined to be together, I don't believe in God, but
        I believe a higher power is looking out for us, and our relationship, making sure we will forever be happy
        together. Even through all the mistakes I made, speaking to you, dating you or meeting you was never one of
        them. I truly love you, and I will do anything to make sure you feel my love throughout every second of your
        life. I promise you, we will marry, we will end up living together, in a beautiful house, living our dream life.
